            <h1>Hashing</h1>
            <h2>Definition of Hashing</h2>
            <p>
                Hashing is a technique used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. It is a process of mapping large amounts of data to smaller tables using a mathematical function called a hash function. The output of this function is a hash value or hash code, which is typically used to index and retrieve items in a hash table efficiently.
            </p>

            <h2>Hash Function</h2>
            <p>
                A hash function is an algorithm that takes an input (or key) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, which is typically a hash code. The goal of the hash function is to distribute the keys evenly across the hash table to minimize collisions.
            </p>

            <h2>Collision Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                Collisions occur when two or more keys are mapped to the same index in a hash table. Various methods can be used to handle collisions, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Open Addressing:</strong> Methods like linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing resolve collisions by finding another open slot in the hash table.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Chaining:</strong> In this method, each index in the hash table points to a linked list of items, all of which have the same hash index.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applications of Hashing</h2>
            <p>
                Hashing has several important applications, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hash Tables:</strong> Efficient data storage and retrieval using a key-value pair system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cryptography:</strong> Hash functions are used in security applications to encrypt data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Deduplication:</strong> Identifying and removing duplicate data using hash codes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
